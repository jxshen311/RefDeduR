RefDeduR is an R package that supports accurate and high-throughput reference deduplication. It is especially useful for large datasets and operates on standard bibliographic information (i.e., It does not require information that cannot be retrieved from a mainstream search engine such as PMID.)

The deduplication pipeline is modularized into finely-tuned text normalization, three-step exact matching, and two-step fuzzy matching processes. The package features a decision-tree algorithm and considers preprints and conference proceedings when they co-exist with a peer-reviewed version.
