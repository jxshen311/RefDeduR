Little is known, however, about the driving forces that lead to the preference or suitability of one rotamer over another. Construction of 3D hydropathic interaction maps for nearly 30,000 tyrosines reveals the environment around each, in terms of hydrophobic (pi-pi stacking, etc.) and polar (hydrogen bonding, etc.) interactions. After partitioning the tyrosines into backbone-dependent (phi{symbol}, psi) bins, a map similarity metric based on the correlation coefficient was applied to each map-map pair to build matrices suitable for clustering with k-means. The first bin (-200deg<=phi{symbol}&lt;-155deg -205deg<=psi&lt;-160deg), representing 631 tyrosines, reduced to 14 unique hydropathic environments, with most diversity arising from favorable hydrophobic interactions with many different residue partner types. Polar interactions for tyrosine include surprisingly ubiquitous hydrogen bonding with the phenolic OH and a handful of unique environments surrounding the tyrosine backbone. The memberships of all but one of the 14 environments are dominated (&gt;50%) by a single chi1/chi2 rotamer. The last environment has weak or no interactions with the tyrosine ring and its chi1/chi2 rotamer is indeterminate, which is consistent with it being composed of mostly surface residues. Each tyrosine residue attempts to fulfill its hydropathic valence and thus, structural water molecules are seen in a variety of roles throughout protein structure.

These highly resistant bacteria are mostly associated with a single Kp clonal group, CG258, but the reasons for its host and hospital adaptation remain largely unknown. Methods We analyzed the in vivo evolution of a colistin-resistant KPC-Kp CG258 strain that contaminated a patient following an endoscopy and was responsible for a fatal bacteremia 4.5 years later. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 17 KPC-Kp isolates from this patient; single-nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed and their implication in antimicrobial resistance and bacterial host adaptation investigated. Results The patient KPC-Kp strain diversified over 4.5 years at a rate of 7.5 substitutions per genome per year, resulting in broad phenotypic modifications. After 2 years of carriage, all isolates restored susceptibility to colistin. Higher expression of the fimbriae conferred the ability to produce more biofilm, and the isolate responsible for a bacteremia grew in human serum. The convergent mutations occurring in specific pathways, such as the respiratory chain and the cell envelope, revealed a complex long-term adaptation of KPC-Kp. Conclusions Broad genomic and phenotypic diversification and the parallel selection of pathoadaptive mutations might contribute to long-term carriage and virulence of KPC-Kp CG258 strains and to the dissemination of this clone.

Many HAIs are due to contamination from workers' hands and contact with high-touch surfaces. Therefore, we set out to test the efficacy of a new preventative technology, AIONX(r) Antimicrobial Technologies, Inc's cleanSURFACES(r), which is designed to complement daily chemical cleaning events by continuously preventing re-colonization of surfaces. To that end, we swabbed surfaces before (Baseline) and after (Post) application of the cleanSURFACES(r) at various time points (Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, and Day 28). To circumvent limitations associated with culture-based and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing methodologies, these surface swabs were processed using metatranscriptomic (RNA) analysis to allow for comprehensive taxonomic resolution and the detection of active microorganisms. Overall, there was a significant (P &lt; 0.05) global reduction of microbial diversity in Post-intervention samples. Additionally, Post sample microbial communities clustered together much more closely than Baseline samples based on pairwise distances calculated with the weighted Jaccard distance metric, suggesting a defined shift after product application. This shift was characterized by a general depletion of several microbes among Post samples, with multiple phyla also being reduced over the duration of the study. Notably, specific clinically relevant microbes, including Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridioides difficile and Streptococcus spp., were depleted Post-intervention. Taken together, these findings suggest that chemical cleaning events used jointly with cleanSURFACES(r) have the potential to reduce colonization of surfaces by a wide variety of microbes, including many clinically relevant pathogens.

Epub 2021 Aug 20.","BACKGROUND: Normal airway microbial communities play a central role in respiratory health but are poorly characterized. Cigarette smoking is the dominant global environmental influence on lung function, and asthma has become the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide. Both conditions have major microbial components that are incompletely defined. METHODS: We investigated airway bacterial communities in a general population sample of 529 Australian adults. Posterior oropharyngeal swabs were analyzed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The microbiota were characterized according to their prevalence, abundance and network memberships. FINDINGS: The microbiota were similar across the general population, and were strongly organized into co-abundance networks. Smoking was associated with diversity loss, negative effects on abundant taxa, profound alterations to network structure and expansion of Streptococcus spp. By contrast, the asthmatic microbiota were selectively affected by an increase in Neisseria spp. and by reduced numbers of low abundance but prevalent organisms. INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that the healthy airway microbiota in this population were contained within a highly structured ecosystem, suggesting balanced relationships between the microbiome and human host factors. The marked abnormalities in smokers may contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. The narrow spectrum of abnormalities in asthmatics encourages investigation of damaging and protective effects of specific bacteria. FUNDING: The study was funded by the Asmarley Trust and a Wellcome Joint Senior Investigator Award to WOCC and MFM (WT096964MA and WT097117MA).

In this study, dust-borne fungal communities were elucidated from a water-damaged office building located in the northeastern region of the United States using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA gene sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from 5 mg of floor dust derived from 22 samples collected from either the lower floors (n = 8) or a top floor (n = 14) of the office building. ITS gene sequencing resolved a total of 933 ITS sequences and was clustered into 216 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Analysis of fungal OTUs at the 97% similarity threshold showed a difference between the lower and top floors that was marginally significant (p = 0.049). Species richness and diversity indices were reduced in the lower floor samples compared to the top floor samples and there was a high degree of compositional dissimilarity within and between the two different areas within the building. Fungal OTUs were placed in the phyla Ascomycota (55%), Basidiomycota (41%), Zygomycota (3%), Glomeromycota (0.4%), Chytridiomycota (0.3%), and unassigned fungi (0.5%). The Ascomycota classes with the highest relative abundances included the Dothideomycetes (30%) and Eurotiomycetes (16%). The Basidiomycota consisted of the classes Ustilaginomycetes (14%), Tremellomycetes (11%), and Agaricomycetes (8%). Sequence reads derived from the plant pathogen Ustilago syntherismae were the most abundant in the analysis as were obligate Basidiomycota yeast species that accounted for 12% and 11% of fungal ITS sequences, respectively. ITS gene sequencing provides additional insight into the diversity of fungal OTUs. These data further highlight the contribution of fungi placed in the phylum Basidiomycota, obligate yeasts, as well as xerophilic species that are typically not resolved using traditional culture methods.

Mutation analysis was done by sequencing the rpoB gene encoding RNA polymerase beta-subunit of the rifampicin-resistant mutants. Samples included bacteria exposed to the space environment with and without exposure to UV radiation as well as control samples held in the ISS cabin and at ground. The mutation sites of the rpoB gene obtained from the space-exposed and ISS/ground control samples were similar to the rpoB mutation sites previously reported in D. radiodurans. Most mutations were found at or near the rifampicin binding site in the RNA polymerase beta-subunit. Mutation sites found in UV-exposed samples were mostly shared with non-exposed and ISS/ground control samples. These results suggest that most mutations found in our experiments were induced during procedures that were applied across all treatments: preparation, transfer from our laboratory to the ISS, return from the ISS, and storage before analysis. Some mutations may be enhanced by specific factors in the space experiments, but the mutations were also found in the spontaneous and control samples. Our experiment suggests that the dried cells of the microorganism D. radiodurans can travel without space-specific deterioration that may induce excess mutations relative to travel at Earth's surface. However, upon arrival at a recipient location, they must still be able to survive and repair the general damage induced during travel.

The pathogens were identified using standard methods and the effects of treatments were evaluated on salami after 144 h. The results obtained from 60 RTEM samples showed a higher prevalence in the household samples than the retail samples, although it was not significantly different (p > 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus recorded the highest prevalence. Furthermore, 60% of beef sausage samples were positive for E. coli, 50% of salami samples were positive for L. monocytogenes, while Salmonella was lower in all the RTEM categories. 16s rRNA identified some of the microorganisms such as Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Lelliottia amnigena, and L. monocytogenes. The combined treatment had a higher effect than the single treatment with a 5-log reduction of pathogens; however, the protective effect diminished at storage temperature of more than 4 degrees C. The findings show a higher efficacy of treating foodborne pathogens with combined treatment.
